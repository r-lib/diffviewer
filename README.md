diffviewer provides an HTML widget for visually comparing files. It
currently wraps three javascript libraries:

- [resemble.js](https://rsmbl.github.io/Resemble.js/) for comparing
  images.
- [daff.js](https://paulfitz.github.io/daff/) for comparing data frames.
- [jsdiff](https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff) for everything else.

It extracts out common UI provided by
[shinytest](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest/index.html) and
[vdiffr](https://vdiffr.r-lib.org).

## Installation

You can install the released version of diffviewer from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("diffviewer")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(diffviewer)
path1 <- tempfile()
writeLines(letters, path1)
path2 <- tempfile()
writeLines(letters[-(10:11)], path2)

visual_diff(path1, path2)
```
